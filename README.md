# EquityBot: AI-Powered Equity News Research Tool 

EquityBot is a next-gen research assistant designed for deep financial analysis. Powered by Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) and state-of-the-art generative AI (LLaMA via Groq), it transforms raw news into actionable insights. Users can input URLs of financial articles and ask complex questions, receiving accurate, source-grounded answers in real-time.

Under the hood, EquityBot uses vector embeddings (via HuggingFace’s gte-small), FAISS-based similarity search, and document chunking for scalable retrieval. It's an intelligent blend of LLMs, semantic search, and streamlit interactivity—built for analysts, by analysts.

## Features

- Load URLs or upload text files containing URLs to fetch article content.
- Process article content through LangChain's UnstructuredURL Loader
- Construct an embedding vector using OpenAI's embeddings and leverage FAISS, a powerful similarity search library, to enable swift and effective retrieval of relevant information
- Interact with the LLM's (Chatgpt) by inputting queries and receiving answers along with source URLs.


## Installation

1.Clone this repository to your local machine using:

```bash
  git clone https://github.com/rudhreesh/Equity_research_tool.git
```
2. Install the required dependencies using pip:

```bash
  pip install -r requirements.txt
```
3.Set up your Groq API key by creating a .env file in the project root and adding your API

```bash
  GROQ_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
```
## Usage/Examples

1. Run the Streamlit app by executing:
```bash
streamlit run main.py

```

2.The web app will open in your browser.

- On the sidebar, you can input URLs directly.

- Initiate the data loading and processing by clicking "Process URLs."

- Observe the system as it performs text splitting, generates embedding vectors, and efficiently indexes them using FAISS.

- The embeddings will be stored and indexed using FAISS, enhancing retrieval speed.

- The FAISS index will be saved in a local file path in pickle format for future use.
- One can now ask a question and get the answer based on those news articles
